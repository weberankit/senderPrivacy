        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how the **Sender** Extension ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our extension.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            When you use the **Sender** Gmail Automation Extension, we request access to your Gmail account to allow you to send emails using pre-saved messages. The data we access includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your email address.</li>
            <li>Message content you send through the Gmail API.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Data Never Touches Our Server</h2>
        <p>
            We want to reassure you that **Sender** does not collect or store your data on our servers. All data used by the extension is handled directly through the Gmail API, and your email content and other sensitive information never leave Google's secure infrastructure.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>
            We only use the data we collect to enable the functionality of the extension. Specifically:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sending emails on your behalf using the Gmail API.</li>
            <li>Managing saved messages for quick access and sending.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do not share your personal information with third parties, except when required by law.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take reasonable precautions to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.
        </p>

        <h2>Revoking Access</h2>
        <p>
            You can revoke access to your Gmail account at any time by visiting your Google account settings under the "Security" section.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
            Our extension does not use cookies to track your activities.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated date. Please check this page periodically for updates.
        </p>
